			NOT_AVAILABLE =>"There ain't none",

DEPENDENCIES

	use HTML::HeadParser;

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a hash of useful summary information from "meta" and "body"
    elements.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
    $NOT_AVAILABLE
    May be over-ridden by supplying the constructor with a field of the same
    name. See the THE SUMMARY STRUCTURE entry elsewhere in this document.

CONSTRUCTOR (new)
    Accepts a hash-like structure...

    PATH
        Path to file to process.

    SUMMARY
        Filled after "get_summary" is called (see the METHOD get_summary
        entry elsewhere in this document and the THE SUMMARY STRUCTURE entry
        elsewhere in this document).

    FIELDS
        An array of "meta" tag "name"s whose "content" value should be
        placed into the respective slots of the "SUMMARY" field after
        "get_summary" has been called.

  THE SUMMARY STRUCTURE

    A field of the object which is a hash, with key/values as follows:

    AUTHOR, TITLE
        HTML "meta" tag of same names.

    DESCRIPTION
        Content of the "meta" tag of the same name.

    LAST_MODIFIED_META, LAST_MODIFIED_FILE
        Time since of the modification of the file, respectively according
        to any "meta" tag of the same name, and according to the file
        system. If the former does not exist, it takes the value of the
        latter.

    CREATED_META, CREATED_FILE
        As above, but relating to the creation date of the file.

    FIRST_PARA
        The first HTML "p" element of the document.

    HEADLINE
        The first "h1" tag; failing that, the first "h2"; failing that, the
        value of "$NOT_AVAILABLE".

    PLUS...
        Any meta-fields specified in the "FIELDS" field.

METHOD get_summary
    Optionally takes an argument that over-rides and re-sets the "PATH"
    field. Otherwise uses the "PATH" field to get a summary and put it into
    the hash that is the "SUMMARY" field. See also the THE SUMMARY STRUCTURE
    entry elsewhere in this document.

    Return "1" on success, "undef" on failure, setting "$!" with an error
    message.

METHOD load_file
    Optionally takes an argument that over-rides and re-sets the "PATH"
    field. Otherwise uses the "PATH" field to load an HTML file and return a
    reference to a scalar full of it.

    Return a reference to a scalar of HTML, or "undef" on failure, setting
    "$!" with an error message.

TODO
    Maybe work on URI as well as file paths.
